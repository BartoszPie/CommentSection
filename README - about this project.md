## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
- **Bonus**: Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.
- **My Bonus**: Login options/clear local storage option/reasonably responsive width up to 320px/positioning of comment depending upon it's score

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Pure JS
- JSON file

### What I learned

I was using JSON file first time, so i spent some time to really learn it and later on have fun with it :)

I created most of my code in js, so it would be generated based on local storage - that was new for me too.


### Continued development

That was my last project with pure JS so i was trying to use a lot of it for this website. Next is React and then angular 

### Useful resources

- I was trying to get along with chat GPT and using it made me work faster.
